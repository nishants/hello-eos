EOS <https://eos.io/> <https://github.com/EOSIO/eos> is an open source smart contract platform. 



1. Kylin <https://tools.cryptokylin.io/#/tools/create> is one of EOS testnets.

On Kylin, create a single transaction with the following 2 actions.

\- send 2 EOS to eosasia11111

\- delegate your account with 1.1 EOS in cpu and 0.5 EOS in net

Provide the transaction id of your transaction.



2.  In EOS, voting determines who gets to produce blocks.

At <https://eosflare.io/> and <https://eospark.com/> , different amount of EOS are shown to be voting.

Please explain if any of them are accurate.



3. Recently, a bug was exploited in one of EOS most used dapp. <https://medium.com/@eosbetcasino/eosbet-transfer-hack-statement-31a3be4f5dcf>

Please explain the bug, provide an example vulnerable contract and an example on how it can be exploited.
